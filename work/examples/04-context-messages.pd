#X text 40 157 The Context message system is very powerful. It can
simplify arithmetic expressions with more or less the same ability
as a scientific calculator. Any expression inside brackets will be
solved \, and you can have multiple levels of brakets (up to 4 or 5
is safe). Anything outside of brackets is treated as text and ignored.
;
#X text 40 246 There is also a series of variables that you can plug
into the message. For example \, ?10 gives a random number \, maximum
10;
#X obj 107 302 context :X 11 :Z 18 :a ' d (?10 + 30) \\\; ' :d 1 :n
ex1 :x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 :ID 2;
#X obj 287 90 receive ex1-;
#X text 50 560 You can see all the variable in the help menu: MESSAGES->VARIABLES
;
#X text 49 599 Also \, read "ADVANCED USE->ID->TAGS to learn how the
messages are being sent to "receive ex1-";
#X text 49 388 One variable that is very useful for envelopes is ¬
(an awkward character that might not be on your keyboard! I'll change
this soon.). ¬ calculates the distance between the current toggle
and the next one:;
#X obj 116 461 context :X 12 :Z 16 :a ' ¬ \\\; ' :d 7 :n ex1 :x 1

#X connect 5 0 1 0;
